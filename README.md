This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to model asset price movements and assess portfolio risk. By leveraging historical return data and random sampling techniques, the simulation generates thousands of potential future price scenarios to estimate key metrics such as expected returns, volatility, and Value at Risk (VaR). The goal is to provide a data-driven approach for financial decision-making, enabling better risk management and portfolio optimization. Future enhancements may include more sophisticated stochastic models, sensitivity analysis, and integration with real-time financial data.
